Online identity record built to allow flexible description of self and a simple but sufficiently granular control over privacy.  Uses the three concepts of 
facets, lenses, and contexts to let people define their own representation.  A facet is a simple box displayed on the website, holding a title, image,
and text (with the image and text both being optional).  A lens is a page that holds a bunch of facets.  Facets are displayed three to a row, and 
will fill the page.  To scroll between pages, I'm using the [fullPage.js](https://github.com/alvarotrigo/fullPage.js#fullpagejs) library by Alvaro Trigo
which allows for a full page scroll similar to the new iPhone 5S website.  In the future, lenses containing more facets than fit on one screen will
allow horizontal scrolling in a slideshow manner to view more facets.
